In this tab **(1)** the user has access to a zone where every address that are associated wiht him are presented in a table **(2)**. In this table the user can perform two actions. One of them is the possibility of changing the address' name, i.e. give a more friendly name, an alias, to an address. This new name will be used in the sidebar on the left.

Furthermore, the user can "hide" an address (still in development), i.e. make sure that a certain address does not appear in the sidebar nor is it used in calculations of bills totals and amount of waste produced. By hiding an address, it does not stop it from being associated with the user or that the amount of waste produced in it is not counted, it will only impact the visual interface.
